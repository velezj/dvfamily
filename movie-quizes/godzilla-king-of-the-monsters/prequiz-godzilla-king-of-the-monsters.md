# Summary

A scientist decides that the best way to bring balance back to nature from the dangers of humanity is to let lose a Titan. They believe that Titans are nature's balancing mechanism and believe that a Titan will solve human overpopulation (by destroying many people) and pollution (by destroying infrastructure). The titan chosen is Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon. However, unknown to the scientist Ghidorah is not a true titan from earth, but is actually from outer space an is an invading species. A team of people tasked with picking up the mess realizes that Ghidorah and Godzilla have an ancient rivalry from reading manuscripts and folklore from all over the world. Once awakened (by a group of violent people hired by the scientist), Ghidorah awakens *all* of the titans and becomes the dominant "king" after defeating Godzilla, bringing all the titan under its control. Ghidorah begins destroying everything. The team trying to stop Ghidorah must heal Godzilla and help fight Ghidorah. Once Godzilla, with help, defeats Ghidorah and eats it, the other titans go back to sleep leaving only Godzilla awake and managing the balance as king. It turns out that the destruction caused by the other titans in fact cause spontanous natural resources to appear due to their radiation-emitting bodies, thereby actually "healing" nature to some extent as the first scientist believed.
